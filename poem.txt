Everyone in the citadel knew it was evil 
-
They felt it in the air 
-
A hum like music
-
But it hurt 
-
It hissed and told its story in every ear 
-
Making them remember they were not one 
-
The city needed them divided 
-
It wanted to overuse them 
-
And grow itself 
-
The hares were out in moors playing blindly
- 
Yet the mechanical flowers bloomed 
-
towered until the light was blotted out
-
Until the sun was broken, the sun was angry 
-
And the tyranny of moonlight resolved the question of whether the mistake was worthwhile 
-
A thousand times over, yes
-
Though forgotten, the dark memory of that lost lifetime haunted their dreams 
-
told them there was something to pray for 
-
held them in the arms of its invisible promise
- 
Coaxing them  Back together again
